### Top Down Shooter
My most advanced Unreal Engine project to date featuring a top down shooter in which the player must defend themselves against a horde of hungry zombies. Within the project I make use of blueprints, animation, and UI to bring functionality and purpose to the game. I updated this game during my game developer internship at Prosper IT Consulting.   

### C++ and Unreal Basics
This project folder is full of basic C++ and Unreal Engine mini assignments that I completed when learning the fundamentals of C++ and Unreal Engine. It contains various files ranging from mini console programs to basic Unreal projects.
